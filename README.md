# Colonial Routes

This project simulates Brazil's transportation infrastructure in the 18th century through land, riverine, and maritime routes. The geographic data was produced based on a large collection of diverse historical maps (notably, the Guia dos Caminhantes) and descriptive itineraries, combined with a large set of secondary literature. It also incorporates the data and infrastructure of the Digital Atlas of Portuguese America (http://lhs.unb.br/atlas). This project is currently under development.
